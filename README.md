# Arduino Fire Fighter

A Smart Robo which can detect the fire and approach towards fire in order to extinguish the fire.

This robot is equipped with flame sensors used to sense environmental fire and feed the signals to the Î¼C which in turn triggers the dc motor and pump along with the sevro mounted on the top of the robot.

This sprinkles water in order to extinguish the fire unitl fire not stopped
This robot implements the concepts of environmental fire sensing, proportional motor control. The motor driver is used for the bidirectional control of the motors equipped in the robot.

## Hardware 

- 3 X Flame Sensor
- L293D Motor Driver
- 4 X BLDC Motor 12V
- Arduino Nano Dev Board
- Push Button, RGB LED's and bunch of wires

## Build Flash Monitor

You can build, flash and monitor the app via Arduino IDE as usual :)

## Simulation
